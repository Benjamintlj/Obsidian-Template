This vault is split into five main areas—Active, How-To's, Architecture, Coding, Metadata and a Read Me folder.

I like to split my notes into Volatile and Non-Volatile sections, Volatile is anything that you probably won't care about in a few weeks, Non-Volatile is stuff that you keep having to come back to because you have a terrible memory.

## Active
This section holds everything you're actively working on:
- Quick notes, QA and tickets you’re tackling now
- **Epics** & **Sprints**: larger work items that break down into tickets
	- Epics hold tickets related to that epic
	- Where as a sprint holds miscellaneous tickets related to a sprint 

Link Epics and Sprints to specific tickets or QA notes to keep your workflow connected, via backlinks `[[noteName]]`.

## Non-Volatile

### How-To's
Short how-to notes you might forget, such as:
- Running a database migration
- Connecting to an external service
- Any repeatable procedure you might need later

### Architecture
Organized into two parts:
- **Diagrams** (built with Excalidraw) for high-level overviews
- **Notes** for in-depth details, all linked back to the diagrams

### Coding
Your toolbox of scripts and snippets—anything code-related you’ll reuse.

## Metadata
Miscellaneous setup and support files:
- Templates
- Excalidraw and Canvas files kept here so they don’t clutter other folders

## Read Me
A catch-all section for any extra info.
