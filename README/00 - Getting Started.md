## Overview

I have made this vault to help with my workflow at work, because no other note taking software provides the flexibility and interlinking capabilities that Obsidian does. In any-case I see no harm in making this template open source, so feel free to use it. I have designed this to work specifically offline, with reputable open source plugins.

This repository provides a Git-backed, offline-first Obsidian workflow that uses backlinking and templates to interlink architecture diagrams, notes, and ticket references into a concise, version-controlled knowledge graph.

In the following series of READMEs, I am going to explain how you can utilise this repo for your own work flow.
